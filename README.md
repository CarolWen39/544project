## Adversarial Attack Against Fake News Detection NLP Model

#### Jianing Chen, Ruoyu Li, Connie Liang, Mengsha Wen, Di Wu


We use pre-trained model Bertweet and Flair to classify the news, and analyze the attacking success rate and running time of 5 methods for generating adversarial examples.

### Raw Data
 True.csv, False.csv and fake_or_real_news.csv are the raw data we use for classification. References are in our report.

### Data
 dataforattacking.csv is the data prepared for attacking.
 
### Data Preparation
 We do data preprocessing such as removing stop words, combining two source datasets, etc.
 
### Code
 The code we ran to get experiment results.
 
### Result
 Results and summarys of our experiment results for those five attacking methods.
